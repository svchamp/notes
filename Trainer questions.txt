-------------------------------------- Testing --------------------------------------------------

Q. What is VV model?
	->The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation model, is a type of 
	Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model.
	->Verification involves static analysis of documents by Review, Walkthrough and Inspection.Validation evaluates whether specified requirements are met.
	->It is represented by a 'V shape' with 2 legs: left leg-development phases
	right leg-testing phases
	->Phases: Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenace.
	->Used for safety critical systems.

Q. Black Box testing?
	->Knowledge of code is not required.Done by testers.Testing is done based on customer req.
	Ex: System testing

Q. What is system testing?
	->System testing verifies the end-to-end behavior of a software application.
	->Its goal is to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in the overall functionality of the software.
	->Typically conducted after unit and integration tests are completed.
	->Ex: Performance testing, load testing, Security testing, Usability testing,
	Compatibility testing.

Q. White Box testing?
	->Requires knowledge of code. Done by developers.
	Ex: Unit and Integration testing.

Q. What are the components of Selenium? 
	-> Selenium is a powerful web browser automation tool. It consists of 4 major components:
	1) Selenium IDE: It is a complete integrated development environment for Selenium tests. 
	It records and plays back a user’s actions while interacting with a web browser. 
	2) Selenium RC(Remote Control): Selenium RC is a server written in Java that accepts commands for the browser via HTTP.
	It enables writing automated tests for web applications in any programming language.
	3) Selenium WebDriver: It is a web framework. It is used for browser automation. It is the successor to Selenium RC. Unlike Selenium RC, 
	WebDriver directly starts a browser instance and controls it without requiring a special server.
	4) Selenium Grid:It facilitates parallel execution of tests across multiple machines or browsers.
	Selenium grid works with WebDriver to execute tests remotely.
